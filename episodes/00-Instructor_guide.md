## Setup

There is a seperate file for the setiup instructions for installing OpenRefine. [setup](../setup.md)

## The datasets used

The only dataset used in this lesson is the 'Moz_SAFI_Survey_Final_results.csv' file which is in the data folder.

It will need to be downloaded to the local machine before it can be loaded into OpenRefine.
